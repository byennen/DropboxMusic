Install
 * Run the following command:
 script/plugin install git://github.com/gabrielg/asset_auto_include.git
 
== Usage

 Add the following to the head of your template file

 <%= javascript_auto_include_tags %>
 <%= stylesheet_auto_include_tags %>
  
 Now each time the template is loaded javascript files in the public/javascripts/app
 folder and CSS files in the public/stylesheets/app folder that correspond to the name of the 
 current controller or view will be auto loaded. It's also possible for the same javascript 
 or CSS file to be loaded by multiple views by adding the name of each view to the filename 
 separated by the "-" character, e.g. to load a javascript file in the new and edit views 
 create a file named new-edit.js. Any number of views can be strung together using this naming 
 convention. For example:

 /public
   /javascripts
     /app
       /users
         controller.js
         edit.js
       /roles
         controller.js
       /accounts
         show-new-edit-create.js
   /stylesheets
     /app
       /users
         controller.css
         edit.css
  
 Assuming the above file structure loading each of the following urls would include:
 
 mydomain.com/users             # includes controller.js and controller.css
 mydomain.com/users/edit/1      # includes controller.js, edit.js, and edit.css
 mydomain.com/users/show/1      # includes controller.js
 mydomain.com/roles             # includes roles.js
 mydomain.com/accounts          # no files included
 mydomain.com/accounts/show/1   # includes show.js and show-new-edit-create.js
 mydomain.com/accounts/new      # includes show-new-edit-create.js
 mydomain.com/accounts/edit/1   # includes show-new-edit-create.js
 mydomain.com/accounts/create   # includes show-new-edit-create.js
